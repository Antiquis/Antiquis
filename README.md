### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Josh - a musician and system administrator based in the UK! I am hugely committed (no pun intended!) to free and open source software, so I spend a lot of my time tinkering with my system and working on cool projects.

I'm currently working on:
- An open source Ensemble Manager for orchestras;
- A bot for Server.pro's Discord server;
- A collection of useful scripts for musicians;

#### Get in touch!
